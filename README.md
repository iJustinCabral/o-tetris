### Classic Tetris (Written in Odin)

Next up on the list of games I want to recreate using Odin comes Tetris. 

Known as one of the greatest puzzle games of all time, Tetris holds a special place in my memories as it came with a GameBoy I had when I was around six years old. I also see this as an opportunity to get used to some mechanics I want to bring over to a smaller game project I plan to start after this.

The best thing about Tetris is it's simplicity. Like most things thare are often best designed, they bring order to complexity and the result is beautiful.
